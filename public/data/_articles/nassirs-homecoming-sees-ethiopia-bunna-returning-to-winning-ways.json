In the twentieth minute, Tafesse Solomon blasted a shot from a cutback inside the box after Addis Ababa lost possession in their defensive third.\n\nIt was a cross from the left that resulted in Ethiopian Coffee going ahead, with Robel Teklemichael flicking the early cross from Asrat Tonjo towards William Solomon who volleyed the ball into the goal.\n\nThe same sequence was nearly replicated in the thirty-sixth minute when a cross from the left resulted in another  William Solomon chance, Solomon couldn't score this time as his header was poor.\n\nAbubekir Nassir’s return from South Africa was a big boost for Ethiopian Coffee, he had an immediate impact as a facilitator in Coffee’s attacks with clever flicks and dribbles keeping Coffee’s offensive play ticking. Coffee's left-hand side continued causing Addis problems as the interplay between Tonjo and Nassir on the left side of the box opened up a one-on-one chance which Tonjo blasted over the bar.\n\nThe second half saw a much-improved performance from Addis Ababa, with them registering six shots and four on target in contrast to the first half where they only had two shots and one on target. Keyman Fitsum Tilahun continued to impress as the left-winger with his dribbling ability and shots from range.\n\n![](/images/uploads/fitsum.jpg)\n\n> Fitsum Tilahun and William Solomon *(Image: Ethiopian Premier League Share Company)*\n\nThe best Addis Ababa chance, however,  came near the end of the game from Endale Kebede, who used his first touch flick to split open the Ethiopian Coffee defense, unfortunately for him, his shot was too close to keeper Abel Mamo. The save was only as far as Adiss' Elias Ahmed, who scuffed his header. \n\nThe win sees Ethiopian Coffee temporarily up to fifth spot and leaves Addis Abeba City rooted to the bottom three.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->",
