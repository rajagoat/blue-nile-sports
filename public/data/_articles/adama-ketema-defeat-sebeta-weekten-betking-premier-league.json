Languishing in 15th place, the defeat means Sebeta now have to contend with Jimma Aba Jiffar, relegation zone companion, breathing down their necks after their [victory over Addis Ababa Ketema](https://www.bluenilesport.com/articles/jimma-aba-jifar-defeat-addis-ababa-ketema-betking-ethiopian-premier-league) earlier in the day.\n\n \n\nSebeta City elected to sit back, absorb pressure and hit on the counter attack. Against the run of play, Hailemicheal Adefres was able to put Sebeta ahead in the 23rd minute. Zelalem Shiferaw's men managed to hold on to the lead until the break. Despite midfield dominance, Adama were unable to break down Sebeta City and veteran goalkeeper Jemal Tassew.\n\n \n\nGalvanized at halftime, Adama emerged and immediately upped the tempo. Five minutes into the half, the scorer of Ethiopia’s first goal at the 2021 African Cup of Nations Dawa Hotessa converted a spot kick given for handball.\n\n \n\nAdama knocked on Sebeta's goal multiple times but were denied again and again by Jemal Tassew. In the 79th minutes Dawa dropped deep to to start a counterattack which led to substitute Abdisa Jemal scoring the winning goal. \n\n \n\nLed by Dawa Hotessa, the Ethiopian National Team’s hero in Cameroon, Adama have only lost once and with the win, have climbed to fifth in the table. Sebeta will be disappointed they let an early lead slip and remain rooted to second from bottom.",
