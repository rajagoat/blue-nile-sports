Abel has now scored three goals in back-to-back games as he eyes a return to the national team. Kenean Markneh widened the lead in the twentieth as he capitalized on Bahir Dar's goalkeeper Abubeker Nuri's mistake to score an open goal.\n\n \n\nThe Blue Waves are still without head coach Abraham Mebrahtu, who is away temporary due to his being appointed a member of the CAF technical committee that analyzes player and team performances at the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon.\n\n \n\nWithout their head coach, Bahir Dar have now suffered back to back defeats which have them back in eight place, some nine points off of league leaders St. George. The Horsemen extend their unbeaten streak to eleven games.\n\n \n\nBahir Dar has but a single victory in its past five games and will look to bounce back against Hawassa City next Thursday.",
