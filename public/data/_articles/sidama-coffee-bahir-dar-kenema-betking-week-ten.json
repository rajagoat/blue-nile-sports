In the seventh minute, he missed a sitter, skying a decently crossed ball over the bar from close blank range.\n\nBut on the half hour mark, another AFCON veteran in Fitsum Alemu, found himself in the box and with his back to goal, turned and slammed it off the upright and in to give Bahir Dar the lead.\n\nBut Sidama Coffee came out guns ablazing in the second half. Coach Gebremedhin Haile had thrown on Brook Mulugeta and the super sub equalized heading home Tewodros Tafesseâ€™s corner in the 70th minute. Momentum was on Sidama's side and with two minutes to play, Firew Solomon's through ball found Habtamu Gezahegn in acres of space. He laid it off to Yegezu Bogale to slot home and complete the comeback.\n\nIt was Yegezu's league leading sixth goal in ten games. With back to back wins, Sidama Coffee have drawn level with Bahir Dar and Ethiopian Coffee and the three sides each have fourteen points. Goal difference gives Bahir Dar the edge, as they currently sit in fifth, with Sidama Coffee in sixth, Ethiopian Coffee in seventh.",
