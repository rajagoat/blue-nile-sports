  "body": "The Ethiopian National Team will be without Getaneh Kebede after he failed to make the 30-man squad for the team's upcoming matches. The Wolkite striker and one of the most capped Ethiopians currently playing has not set the BetKing Premier League alight this season with his tally of four goals.\n\nThe Ethiopia Men's National Team will be back on the pitch for the first time since its AFCON group stage exit. The Walias will play a friendly against a Comoros side who enjoyed a good AFCON campaign, knocking out Ghana on the way to the knockout stages. Comoros are under new management as Frenchman Younes Zerdouk replaced departing coach Amir Abdou in February 2022, \n\nOther notable absentees from the Ethiopian National Team squad include Saint George's Gatoch Panom, the only outfield player from the national team squad not getting any minutes during the AFCON campaign, as well as veteran goalkeeper Jemal Tassew.\n\n![](/images/uploads/img-20220315-wa0003.jpg)\n\n> *(Image Source: Ethiopian Football Federation)*\n\nOn the other hand, Wendimagegn Hailu, Yegezu Bogale, Daniel Teshome, Bereket Desta, Fitsum Alemu get their first senior national call-up after impressive performances in the league this season. Biniyam Belay and Willam Solomon make their returns to the squad as well as Ethiopia Coffee's goalkeeper Abel Mamo who replaces Jemal Tassew. Fasil Kenema makes up the most of the national team with six players, with fellow title contenders Saint George trailing closely with five players. Ethiopia Coffee have five players in the national team, punching above their weight relative to their position in the league.",
