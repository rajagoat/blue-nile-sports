Burkina Faso will be strengthened by the return of three players (Bertrand Traore, Saidou Simpore, and Soumaila Ouattara ). On the other hand, first-choice Goalkeeper Herve Koffle has been ruled out for the game following a positive covid test.\n\nBurkina Faso will play Ethiopia at Stade de Kouekong on the 17th of December at 17h 00 local time.",
