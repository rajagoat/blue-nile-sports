  "body": "> *(Image: Reuters)*\n\nWubetu Abate has revamped the lineup ahead of Ethiopia’s final African Cup of Nations group game against Burkina Faso, in which the Walias cannot settle for less than a win if they hope to extend their stay in Cameroon. Getaneh Kebede will be the point man atop a 4-2-3-1 lineup which has no room for Amanuel Gebremichael.\n\nYared Baye returns from suspension to partner Aschalew Tamene at center back, while 25 year old Ethiopian Coffee fullback Asrat Tunjo replaces Suleman Hamid who had a poor outing against Cameroon last week. Asrat as well as Yihun Endashaw will be getting their first AFCON minutes today, as the latter is selected ahead of veteran Mesud Mohammed.\n\n![](/images/uploads/ethio.jpg)\n\nThere was talk of possible fitness issues surrounding Abubeker Nassir, but he’s fit and returns to his position on the left wing to accommodate Getaneh Kebede. Scorer of Ethiopia’s only goal thus far Dawa Hotessa remains in the starting lineup and will play opposite Abubeker, relegating Amanuel Gebremichael to the bench.\n\nUnlike some of the national teams present in Cameroon, Ethiopia hasn’t lost any of its players to covid19. The Walias remain without goalkeeper Fasil Gebremichael and midfielder Shemeles Bekele, who was ruled out of the tournament with injury.",
