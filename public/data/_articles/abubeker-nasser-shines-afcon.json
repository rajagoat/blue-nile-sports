After all, suffering a lopsided defeat at a such a low scoring tournament where minnows like Sierra Leone have kept the mighty Algerians at bay, has got to sting.\n\nNevertheless, Ethiopia put on a show for much of those first forty five minutes with their short passing game that has become part and parcel of the country’s football identity. At the heart of much of their movements, the country’s most promising footballer in years, Abubeker Nassir.\n\nWith Coach Wubetu Abate’s surprising decision to drop Getaneh Kebede from the lineup altogether, Abubeker was given the opportunity to take over Getaneh’s coveted centre forward role, flanked by Amanuel Gebremichael and newly drafted Dawa Hotessa.\n\nIn his new role, dropping back to link up play and moving in sync with attacks he’d engineer, he was sterling. After a lacklustre showing against Cape Verde, he was a man reborn, setting up attacks, linking play and providing the Walias with the creativity they so sorely lacked in their opening fixture.\n\nHe mesmerized and became his team's on field leader, despite his youth. Minutes into the game, his threaded pass into the onrushing Amanuel led to Dawa’s opening goal.\n\n![](/images/uploads/abuki-edit.jpg)\n\n> Abubeker excelled against Cameroon on what ended up being a difficult night for the Walias *(Image: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images)*\n\nLeft isolated on the wing for entire periods of the Cape Verde game, Abubeker was eventually taken off in the final stages, as Wubetu Abate brought Algeria based Mujib Kassim on in an attempt to chase a point. Fans of the lad were eager for him to showcase his talents on the continental stage and with that, the talents of the most promising footballer to emerge from the country of 120 million people.  \n\nThe diminutive number 10 has bedazzled fans of the Ethiopian Premier League for several years now, with his pace, finesse and finishing. Since signing for Ethiopian Coffee as a sixteen year old, the magenta clad side has built their team around the young star. It has been five years of mazy runs, strikes with both feet, step overs and goals after goals, after goals. His mind blowing 29 goals in 23 games last season, [shattered](https://supersport.com/football/ethiopian-premier-league/news/210516_Abubekher_Nassir_breaks_Kabedes_goals_record) the Ethiopian Premier League record for most goals in a season, which was held by none other than his strike partner Getaneh Kebede. His strike rate at international level, three goals in thirteen caps, is a result of Coach Wubetu Abate preferring to play him out wide.\n\nHis stock rose over the course of the AFCON and World Cup qualifying campaigns, as he was key part of Ethiopia’s successful qualification for Cameroon 2021 including playing in the historical 2-1 victory at Bahir Dar Stadium over much fancied Cote d’Ivoire as a teenager. Local media reports described offers being tabled from clubs in Egypt, Algeria and South Africa.\n\n![](/images/uploads/gettyimages-1237700173-612x612.jpg)\n\n> (Photo by KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAbubeker has reached the pinnacle of what Ethiopian football has to offer and spending additional years in the country risks stunting his growth curb. Aged 21, time is on his side and despite his wire frame, most Ethiopian fans are confident that given the opportunity, he’d be able to convince a manager in Europe to draw him up a contract.\n\nThis is why Abubeker’s failure to capitalize on the opening match was such a disappointment. Opportunities like this to show the world what he is capable of are few and far between. Nine years ago, at Ethiopia’s last major international tournament appearance, Ethiopia’s talents came of age and put on a display that impressed the neutrals, despite Ethiopia finishing bottom of their group at South Africa 2013.\n\nFollowing the tournament, star striker Salahdin Said [departed](https://www.ethiosports.com/2013/01/25/lierse-make-saladin-said-coup/) for Belgian first division side Lierse S.K. Getaneh Kebede [signed](https://ph.news.yahoo.com/wits-trial-ethiopias-kebede-072127009.html) for South African Premiership side Bidvest Wits F.C. and [Shemeles Bekele](https://www.ethiosports.com/2013/07/02/ethiopian-players-on-the-move/) left Ethiopia for his near decade long and ongoing sojourn across north Africa.

His 90% passing rate, 100% dribbling success and his coming out on top four times out of the six times he duelled for the ball against a team composed of players from Europe’s elite leagues make it clear that he is more than ready to step up.\n\nFootball scouts watching the game would likely agree. The experts, who meticulously pore through data and statistics and have a sixth sense for untapped potential, will have seen enough to be captivated.\n\nWhile Abubeker Nassir is likely bitterly disappointed with Cameroon’s 4-1 rout putting his country on the brink of an early exist, he has more than made his mark. Both his Ethiopian fans, and his newly acquainted admirers from around the world, will be hoping for an encore performance come January 17th.",
