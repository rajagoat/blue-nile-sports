The Crocodiles stunned the 2021 runners-up with a marginal one-nil win to end their eight-game winless streak.\n\nKassaye in his pre-match interview stated that Abubeker had a slight knock from the previous game that kept him out of this game.\n\nArbaminch started the game by pressing high up the pitch and harrying the Coffee backline who were caught out multiple times which the Arbaminch strike force failed to capitalize on. \n\n\n\n As per usual, Ethiopia Coffee dominated possession which suited Arba Minch's game plan to sit back and pounce on any mistakes by The Browns. Ethiopia Coffee dominated possession but couldn't create any clear goal-scoring opportunities in the first half. Coffee had only scored two goals in their previous five BetKing Ethiopian Premier League games so it was no surprise that the half ended goalless. To make matters worse, Coffee midfielder William Solomon was stretched off at the half-hour mark with a horrible injury. \n\n![](/images/uploads/bunna-fans.jpg)\n\nThe only goal of the game came in the 51st minute from Belay Gezahegn as the Ethiopian Coffee backline allowed time and space for Kenyan Striker Erick Kapito to chest the ball down to Gezahegn who was free on goal to slot what would be the winner for Arba Minch. By the end of the game,  Ethiopia Coffee had failed to register any goal attempt or shot on target but enjoyed 73% ball possession. \n\n\n\nAfter this loss, Ethiopia Coffee have now already equaled the number of games they lost for the entirety of last season (five) and are now eight points behind league leaders St.George in seventh place. Results need to change if Kassaye Arage wants to keep his job. Meanwhile, Arba Minch dragged themselves out of the congested relegation zone to move up the table to 9th.\n\n\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"
