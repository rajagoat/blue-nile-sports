  "body": "Ethiopian midfielder Shemeles Bekele and goalkeeper Fasil Gebremichael are injury doubts ahead of Ethiopia’s crucial African Cup of Nations match against host nation Cameroon on Thursday.\n\nThe 32 year old midfielder, a lynchpin of the Ethiopian midfield since making his debut over a decade ago, missed last weekend’s AFCON opening day 1-0 defeat to Cape Verde and hobbled off the pitch after pulling a muscle during a Tuesday training session, according to *Soccer Ethiopia.*\n\nMissing Shemeles would be a huge blow to the Walias, who despite a resilient effort against Cape Verde to keep the score at 1-0 while playing with ten men, were widely perceived to lack creativity in the middle of the park, where they’ve traditionally relied on the diminutive Egypt based midfielder. Shemeles is one of three members of the squad with AFCON experience and one of only two who aren’t plying their trade in the Ethiopian Premier League.\n\nBackup goalkeeper Fasil Gebremichael didn’t train at all on Tuesday, and appears certain to miss the Cameroon clash.",
