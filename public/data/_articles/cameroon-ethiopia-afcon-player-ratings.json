Those fears were dashed in the second half when reality sunk in and the Indomitable Lions romped to victory, scoring three unanswered goals and making quick work of the East African upstarts.\n\n22 Teklemariam Shanko 5/10\n\nFor the most part, the dip into his rating is solely due to his conceding the most goals by a single goalkeeper at the AFCON so far. Otherwise, he did his best to prevent more goals from going in and was let down by his defense on most of the occasions. Could have done better with his positioning for the first goal, but wasn’t at fault for the rest.\n\n15 Aschalew Tamene 4/10\n\nWas part of a somewhat shaky, but relatively solid back line during an unforgettable first half for the Walias. Aschalew’s clearance of a goalscoring opportunity for a corner in the 38th minute was among his finer moments in the game. In the second half when all went downhill, he was about as poor as he had been great. Was unable to deal with a rampaging Vincent Aboubakar.\n\n4 Mignot Debebe 3/10\n\nStruggled all game to deal with Cameroon’s long balls into the final third. Brought in to replace the suspended Yared Baye, could hardly be blamed when considering that Cameroon’s offensive line is of multiple calibers stronger than anything he has dealt with at St. George FC.\n\n20 Ramadan Yesuf 3/10\n\nA torrid time backtracking, as Cameroon repeatedly penetrated his flank to find their path towards the Ethiopian goal. Defensive positioning exhibited in the 33rd minute was a fleeting reminder of the brilliance he showed against Cape Verde. Cameroon’s equalizing and second goals were a result of the acres of spaces granted to the Indomitable Lions by the 20 year old left back.\n\n2 Suleman Hamid 2/10\n\nPerhaps the worst performer in an Ethiopian shirt. Torn to shreds far too many times to count, his extremely poor man marking saw him caught ball watching for Cameroon’s equalizer. Will be extremely fortunate if he isn’t benched for the final group game.\n\n8 Amanuel Yohannes 4/10\n\nAccustomed to his role connecting the midfield with the back four, his good outing against Cape Verde couldn’t be replicated against the Cameroonians who muscled him off the ball and bossed the midfield, minimizing his influence.\n\n3 Mesud Mohammed 4.5/10\n\nPlayed the lion’s share of the game after being sacrificed early against Cape Verde as a result of Yared Baye’s red card. Formidable effort to establish a presence in the midfield, Mesud was among the Ethiopian players who got the most touches of the ball and exerted himself well before, like the rest of his teammates, fading in the second half.\n\n7 Surafel Dagnachew 4/10\n\nGot a decent effort on goal, and was one of three midfield players who fought and largely struggled to counter the Cameroonian influence. Extremely lucky to have not been dismissed after a number of reckless challenges that on any other day, could have resulted in him getting a second yellow card. Hooked at half time.\n\n11 Amanuel Gebremichael 5.5/10\n\nPerformed admirably with his overlapping runs which opened the Cameroonian defense and led to his setting up Dawa Hotessa with the opening goal. Nearly got on the score sheet himself, surprisingly succeeding in shrugging off a challenge with his wire frame and forcing a save out of Onana. 5.5\n\n10 Abubeker Nassir 5/10\n\nShowed great promise on the big occasion and was at the heart of Ethiopian movements and an inspiring first half that had fans wondering if an upset was on the cards. Abubeker’s ball set Amanuel free and led to the opening goal. That hope quickly dissipated in the second half, and Abubeker’s influence waned terribly.\n\n![](/images/uploads/c54d9796-88fd-4bf8-9311-ce4e7c822579_w1597_n_st.webp)\n\n> *Dawa Hotessa (center) celebrates his landmark goal with skipper Mesud Mohammed (right) and Ramadan Yesuf  (Image: Reuters)*\n\n27 Dawa Hotessa  6/10\n\nBroke a four year international scoring duck to tuck home Ethiopia’s first major tournament goal for eight years. Could have reacted quicker and buried a rebound off of Amanuel’s attempt on goal to retake the lead for Ethiopia. With the biggest goal of his life, Dawa will likely leave Cameroon with the happiest tales for the future grandchildren.\n\n13 Firew Solomon 4/10\n\nBrought on in the second half to feature as part of an Ethiopian midfield collapse which saw the little resilience shown by the Walias in the middle of the park completely disappear.\n\n17 Bezabeh Meleyo 3/10\n\nBrought on with just over a quarter of an hour to play, enough time to completely sky a sitter of an opportunity which will haunt him for years to come.\n\n25 Ahmed Rashid  n/a\n\nGiven a runout in defense after Cameroon had packed away the goals they needed to seal their place in the knockout stages.\n\n19 Shimekit Gugsa n/a\n\n9 Getaneh Kebede n/a\n\nCame on when it was too late to matter, but did well to rob a Cameroonian defender of the ball and set up a scoring opportunity that Bezabeh Meleyo blazed over the bar from close range.",
