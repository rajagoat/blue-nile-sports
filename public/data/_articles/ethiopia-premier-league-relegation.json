  "body": "Relegation has been a constant fixture in the Ethiopian Premier League since the inception of the modern League format in 1997. Since then, the Ethiopian Premier League has featured fifty clubs, eight different champions and 39 unique teams to suffer relegation. *Blue Nile Sport* crunched the numbers behind over a decade of footballing data, and presents the little known but interesting stats on teams that have suffered the indignity of relegation from Ethiopia’s top flight. \n\nFor starters, 72% of teams that have participated in the Premier League have experienced relegation on at least once occasion.\n\nOut of the eleven clubs that are yet to be relegated,  seven of them are composed of teams that have only recently joined the Premier League, such as Wolaita Dicha, Wolkite Kenema, Mekelle 70 Enderta, Jimma Aba Jifar, Bahir Dar Kenema, FC Shire Endaselassie and Adigrat Wolwalo. This only leaves us with a handful of Premier League mainstays in St. George, winners of the league on a record fourteen occasions under the current format, Hawassa Kenema, Ethiopia Coffee and Sidama Coffee.\n\nThe fact that several league winning club sides which have went on to make the plunge from the Premier League into the lower divisions, such as Dedebit, Defense FC and Ethio Electric, have more title wins than the ever-present Premier League stalwarts in  Hawassa Kenema and Sidama Coffee, highlights the volatility of Ethiopia’s footballing top flight.\n\nBut the foundations of the various relegated sides vary from club to club. For our analysis of Ethiopian Premier League relegation, it is pertinent to ignore the 2007-08 Premier League season, in which midway through the season, a falling out between clubs and the country’s football federation led to a brief lockout and the eventual reinstatement of the clubs, creating a scenario where twenty five club sides competed to stay in the top flight and finish in the top fourteen, relegating the bottom nine teams.\n\n##### **\"Unluckiest\" Relegation**\n\nWhen looking at what can be deemed “unlucky relegations,” we can compare a team’s average points per game with the figure for points per game during seasons that they were relegated. Conversely, we can also label a club “unlucky” by pinpointing just how close a relegated club side was from safety, points-wise.\n\nDuring the 2009-10 season, Ethiopian Insurance FC had its highest rate of points per game outside of the 2007-08 season,  raking in an average of 1.17657 points per match. The team finished fifteenth out of eighteen club sides competing that season with 40 points won from 34 games played, and was relegated.\n\nCompare that with Wolkite Kenema and Dire Dawa Kenema, who last season, finished the league in ninth and tenth place, the relegation cut-off for the thirteen team league. Their points per game averages last season were 0.91667 and 1.1667 respectively, lower than the 1.17657 tallied by Ethiopian Insurance’s relegated side of 2009-10. And yet, both sides managed to escape relegation.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethiopian Premier League all time historical points per game average of clubs that only just avoided relegation, is 0.96896. This depicts relatively low variation and consistency with regards to how teams near the drop zone have performed.\n\nThere are teams that definitely got what came to them, including the likes of Arba Minch in 2004-05  who got an abysmal seven points in 26 matches (winning one and losing 21) and Hadiya Hosanna FC, who tallied just eight points in 26 games during the 2015-16 season.\n\n![](/images/uploads/picsart_1498326508293.jpg)\n\n> Wild celebrations after Habtamu Wolde (barechested) celebrates scoring the winning goal for Dire Dawa City that clinched them Ethiopian Premier League safety at the end of the 2016-17 season. Habtamu's goal came against Jimma Aba Buna, who suffered relegation as a result (Image: [Soccer Ethiopia](https://soccerethiopia.net/football/29157))\n\n##### **Best and worst offense and defence among relegated teams** \n\nWe get a bit of variety in the playing styles of the teams who languish at the bottom of the table. Some teams opted for a more attacking style while others preferred to fortify their defence.\n\nObviously, neither style of play proved particularly effective for these teams. Looking at the average figures for goals scored and conceded among relegated teams,  But looking at the offensive, defensive stats reveal more about the playing styles of these teams.\n\nLooking at the most forward minded of relegated teams, we find two clubs with very similar stats. Nyala Sports Club scored an average of 1.38462 goals per game throughout the 2003-04 season, a near repeat of Berhanena Selam FC who registered a goals per game average of 1.34615 during the 2002-03 season.\n\nThe lowest scoring relegated team is the defunct Arba Minch Cherka Cherk side of 2004-05 and their woeful 0.35 goals per game. These figures are higher than the statistics for clubs last season, but it would be important to take into account the trends for goals scored and conceded in the league across the years. \n\nJimma Aba Buna had an unusually strong defence despite being banished from the Premier League in 2016-17, conceding just 0.73333 goals per game all season. Interestingly, this was the fifth best defense in the league that season and they still couldn’t stay up.\n\nThat 0.73333 goals conceded average would have ranked second best last season, only behind defending champions Fasil Kenema.\n\nOn the flip side, Dire Dawa Cherka Cherk conceded the most of any relegated team. They shipped an average of 2.4091 goals per game during the 1999-2000 season.\n\n##### **Frequencies of relegation and promotion**\n\nOf the relegated teams, Nyala FC has seen itself relegated on four separate occasions, while Ethiopian Insurance has made the drop three times.\n\nWhile it may be customary to laugh at the annual yo-yo clubs, they’ve also demonstrated tremendous resilience to be able to repeatedly fight their way back into the Premier League after relegation.\n\n![](/images/uploads/template-for-graphics.png)\n\n> A list of \"yo-yo\" clubs, who foght their way back to the Premier League\n\nIs such resilience normal or are these teams outliers? To find out, we took a look at the last season that a club that has been relegated at least once from the league was involved in.  \n\nAvailable data shows that five teams that have been relegated have since won promotion and returned to participate in last season’s league competition. These are Adama Kenema, Dire Dawa Kenema, Fasil Kenema, Hadiya Hosanna and Sebeta Kenema.\n\nWhile this is great, this only accounts for 13% of relegated teams. The grand majority of the relegated teams have been away from the Premier League for a long time. This fact coupled with the fact that the Ethiopian Premier League has been graced by a total of 54 different teams, speaks to the diversity of teams coming up from Ethiopia’s lower tier leagues. \n\nList of Ethiopian Premier League teams to have experienced relegation (in alphabetical order): \n\n Adama Kenema, Addis Ababa Kenema, Addis Ababa Police, Agricultural Marketing, Arba Minch Cherka Cherk, Arba Minch Kenema, Ethiopian Air Force, Bahir Dar University, Banks, Berhanena Selam FC, Dashen Beer, Southern Police, Dedebit, Dire Dawa Cherka Cherk, Dire Dawa Kenema, Dire Dawa Railway, Ethio Electric, Ethiopian Water Works, Fincha Sugar, Guna Trading FC, Hadiya Hosanna, Harar Beer, Harar City, Jimma Aba Bunna, Kombolcha Cherka Cherk, Ethiopian Insurance, Defense FC, Meta Brewery, Metehara Sugar, Muger Cement FC, Nyala, Omedla, Sebeta Kenema, Shashemene Kenema, Tikur Abay Transport, Trans Ethiopia, Woldia Kenema, Wonji Sugar.",
