One of the most successful African football sides, qualifying for the FIFA World Cup more than any other African team, the Indomitable Lions have however, endured trialing times in recent years, failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and last earning a point at the finals of a world cup way back at Korea/Japan 2002 when a single goal courtesy of Samuel Etoo saw them top Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nAFCON success wasn’t that long ago, as Cameroon won their fifth title in 2017. In 2022, Cameroon will hope to overcome the curse that comes with hosting the tournament, as no AFCON host nation has won the tournament or even reached the semifinals since Egypt did so way back in 2006. \n\n\n\nCameroon’s last AFCON showing saw the high profile appointment of Dutch football great Clarence Seedorf as manager in the build up to the tournament, before his unceremonious sacking following the team’s elimination at the quarterfinal stage. His successor in Toni Conceição has a comparatively lower profile and little in terms of managerial experience in African football, having spent much of the past two decades at the helm of club sides in Europe including in his native Portugal and Romania. Nevertheless, Cameroon have demonstrated consistency throughout the AFCON qualifiers, topping their group and losing just once away to Cape Verde, who they will face at the finals on January 17th. The Indomitable Lions eliminated Cote d’Ivoire from 2022 Qatar World Cup contention, defeating them in a do or die encounter last November to seal their place in the final playoff round.\n\n\n\nStyle Of Play:\n\nFormations employed: 4-3-3(Primary formation),4-4-2, 3-5-2\n\n\n\nThroughout recent World Cup and African Cup of Nations qualifying encounters, Cameroon have been relatively unable to overwhelm their opponents, even those they were expected to dominate ‘lesser’ with the amount of possession and or shots on goal. Cameroon edge many of their opponents solely by the quality of their players, which perception wise, could be deemed a weakness or a strength.  \n\n\n\nDespite this, they’ve not been short on results, with AFCON qualification going smoothly. Cameroon have looked most imperious during world cup qualifiers, scoring 12 and only conceding three. Cameroon have excelled with set piece opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe Indomitable Lions will look to improve on play from the back, which has been sloppy and can be taken advantage of by teams who play a high pressing game, as was seen by goals recently conceded against Cape Verde and Mozambique. Additionally, Cameroon defense would need to work on dealing with through balls better, with Cameroonian  centre backs seen struggling to deal with them and frequently caught out with too much space between them.\n\n\n\nPlayers to Watch:\n\n\n\nVincent Aboubakar\n\nThe 29 year old striker and skipper has maintained a solid 0.46 goals per game playing his trade in the top flights of France, Portugal and Turkey. This year, he has contributed to 10 goals in 16 games for the Saudi-based Al-Nassr.  For the national team, he has not been quite as prolific, scoring a goal every three games. He does have the tendency to pop up with goals for the team in a stalemate, with him scoring the crucial late winner against Egypt in the 2017 AFCON final. While not the most technically gifted, he is a capable number 9 in terms of his link up play, and a deadly finisher.\n\n \n\n\n\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting\n\nHaving started off his career primarily playing as an inside forward on the left wing, Moting has been transitioned to playing as the central striker for Bayern Munich. For the indomitable Lions, he has more versatility, being deployed on the wing and in behind in addition to playing central striker. Across all these positions he carries the threat of pace, direct dribbling and finishing with his preferred right foot. Something that sets Choupo-Moting apart from most modern day inside forwards is his physicality, height (6’ 2”) and heading ability. He’ll be a handful for the Ethiopian defense. Throughout his career, Moteng has struggled with his offside awareness and teams have exploited this through offside traps.\n\n\n\nMartin Hongla\n\nA mainstay on the right side of midfield for Cameroon, he can also operate as a defensive midfielder, which he does at club level for Serie A side Hellas Verona. Despite his holding role, he has proven to be one of the main creative outlets for this Cameroonian team. When Cameroon deploy a 4-3-3 formation, Hongla is frequently seen creating chances by drifting to wide areas on the right when opposing defenders are preoccupied with Cameroon's right back. From this area of the pitch, he is known for his ability to deliver dangerous early crosses into the box. When playing with a 4-4-2 formation (which Cameroon rarely do) he tends to be selected as a right midfielder and occupies the wide areas for most of the game.",
