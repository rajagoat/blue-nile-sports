The Ethiopian entrepreneur Yohanes Zewdu, also known as “Johnny Vegas” speaks to Blue Nile Sports from FIFA headquarters in Doha, Qatar.\n\n\n\nLess than a year remains until the 2022 Qatar FIFA World Cup kicks off. The world’s biggest sporting event is projected to be viewed by 1.5 billion spectators according to Host Country Operation Affairs. After spending many years in the periphery, the 22nd edition of the quadrennial tournament will be held for the first time in an Arab country.\n\n\n\nYohanes Zewdu, also known as Johnny, is the founder and CEO of a lifestyle and travel company called Kloudout, which has catered for professional athletes, entertainers, and high-profile clients. Footballers and F1 racers are some of the high-profile athlete-clients of Kloudout. Bacary Sagna, Romelu Lukaku, Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ivan Toney, Rob Holding, Weston McKennie are a few of many footballers that have enjoyed the services of Kloudout.

Hence where the name Johnny Vegas was coined. Guests were greeted with Johnny’s sincere smile. Through time he developed connections with clients and guests and went above and beyond to deliver their needs. His hospitality didn't go unnoticed. It was not long until guests requested for Johnny by name to take care of their travel plans and accommodations in Vegas. His network grew by word of mouth. Soon after Johnny was able to land a big gig in the form of former Arsenal and Manchester City player Samir Nasri, who was referred by a friend who was impressed by Johnny's act of kindness.\n\n\n\nJohnny started from humble beginnings, where he had to find means to survive in his early childhood.   \"I am very fortunate and blessed to be where I am today. I always say that my friends could do the same things but were not fortunate enough to have the opportunities I’ve had. I thank God every day for the blessings that have come my way.\"\n\n\n\n At the time of the interview, Johnny was finalizing travel packages to Qatar for fans of the game from North America and Europe.  Hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world will attend and cheer for their national teams in state-of-the-art stadiums across 3 host cities.. Kloudout has destinations across Europe and Northern America.  Having already established their name in Dubai, the World Cup now presents a new opportunity to add Qatar as a new destination for the company.\n\n \n\nSpeaking on the nature of his career, Johnny states “Through my business, I have met a lot of celebrities and athletes. I can't tell you the number of times I was starstruck by the personalities I have encountered. However, my priority always remains professional. I want my clients to feel that they are in safe hands when using Kloudout’s services. That is my priority, quality service tailored to each individual and characteristic is our number one goal at Kloudout.”\n\n![](/images/uploads/img-20220327-wa0007.jpg)\n\n\n\n> *(Image Source: Yohanes Zewdu Instagram Page)*\n\nThe entrepreneur has never forgotten his roots, despite his ongoing success. He says \" Ethiopia has taught me a lot. I consider it an advantage because we Ethiopians are known for hospitality. I grew up in the metropolitan city of Addis Ababa. The diplomatic capital of Africa. Similar to how football brings people together, we used to have coffee ceremonies that welcomed neighbors for a sip. My way out of the reality of the hardships of life was football. Even though I loved football growing up I wasn't able to take the next step as a professional footballer. Everything happens for a reason.”\n\n\n\nAs a big fan of the Ethiopian National Football Team, Johnny has been impressed by the progress and talent of his country’s football development. “I was impressed watching the Walias at the African Cup of Nations. The talent in Ethiopia deserves the big stages. Players and the federation would be served well to focus on nutrition and fitness, players and coaches that have plied their trade in Europe would be useful in knowledge transfer.”\n\n\n\nHaving spent time with some of the European league's top players, Johnny inferred “Any current and young players in Ethiopia can reach the footballing promise land and play as a professional in Europe. In Football, as it is for any discipline, success is never the result of chance, but it is always the result of a long process, combined with repetition. Believe in yourself! Use the technology at your disposal. Everyone has a smartphone, go on YouTube and replicate what the top performers do on and off the pitch. Educate yourself, Knowledge is power. Build your mental strength. Most of all go out on the pitch and compete, push yourself to the limit. It might sound easy but it is not. Your work ethic should be like a professional playing at the highest level. Results do not appear overnight, give 100%, whether in training or during games.”",
