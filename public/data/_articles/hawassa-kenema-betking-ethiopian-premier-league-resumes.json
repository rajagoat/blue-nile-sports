Both goals came in the second half, with Brook Beyene converting from the spot, before AFCON returnee Mesfin Tafesse finished off a counter attack with a brilliantly taken goal.\n\nBuna have now suffered back to back defeats, having lost to Hadiya Hosanna prior to the African Cup of Nations break.\n\nCoach Kassaye Arage's coffee have now failed to score in back to back games. Nevertheless, he refrained from blaming the failure to score on the absence of their talisman, Abubeker Nassir.\n\n\"Abubeker has his qualities on and off the ball but our inability to score is a reoccurring problem,” the coach told SuperSport. “As a team, we need to find a solution on how to break teams down.\"\n\nHawassa City who had sat above Ethiopia Coffee on goal difference extended the gap, and are third in the table. Coach Zeray Mulu expressed his delight with the result.\n\n\"Our game plan worked. We wanted to press them in our final third, but we quickly realized that wasn't working so we decided to press them a bit higher that's when the gaps opened. We played a good second half.\"",
