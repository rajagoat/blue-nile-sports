  "body": "*(Image: Confederation of African Football)*\n\nOctober 14th 2012 was a historical day in the hearts of many Ethiopian football fans; it marked the East African country’s return to the African Cup of Nations after 31 long years. On the same day, on the other side of the continent, a much smaller nation was having a seminal moment of its own, Cape Verde qualified for its first tournament after an aggregate win over Cameroon. While qualification could be seen as ‘a return to form’ or ‘the rightful place’ for Ethiopians with memories of more successful generations, Cape Verde’s qualification and success came from scratch. The Island Nation’s football development started relatively late due to the length of Portuguese colonialism. Their football federation was formed in 1982 and only joined FIFA in 1986.\n\nIt begs the question of how Cape Verde Made an astronomical rise to the top of the CAF rankings in 2016? One of the biggest reasons was the strategy employed by the Blue Lions to start recruiting players of Cape Verdean ancestry who played in Europe in the 2000s, as the Cape Verdean diaspora outnumber the native population this gave the federation the option to select players with access to first-world academy development, training centers and leagues. It is with these kinds of players that Cape Verde has managed to join the upper echelons of African football with a population of 500,000. The current squad only contains one player that plays in the local league,a stark contrast to the Ethiopian squad.\n\n \n\n \n\n**Players to Watch:**\n\n\n\n***Ryan Mendes(Left winger)*:** Cape Verde's most dangerous asset, this experienced talisman plays his club football as a winger. For Cape Verde, the skipper is usually deployed as an inverted winger on the left as part of the three, or is partnered up with a target man as the second striker.  He has had experience in top-flight European football such as Lille and Nottingham Forest. He has the ability to obliterate highlines with his pace, dribbling, and dangerous right foot. He was involved in 4 of 11 goals for Cape Verde this calendar year.\n\n***Julio Tavares(striker)*:** at 6 ‘2’’, is very much a traditional target man. Most goals for him come  from crosses into the box. He has had quite a success at club level, (he is the all-time top scorer for Dijon with 69 goals). He has not replicated his scoring record with the national team but he plays the facilitator role, using his physicality to link up play via passes and flicks inside the box for his team mates. On set pieces, he will be one of the players that Cape Verde will look to get the ball to.\n\n***Stopira*:** part of the dangerous left hand side of CV’s attack, he has contributed to 3 goals in 8 competitive games this calendar year while also assisting 2 goals . He is also versatile as he can play both in the traditional left back role as well as the ‘Free Centre Back’ in a three man defence.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**Style Of Play:**\n\n\n\n**Formations employed: 4-3-3(3),5-3-2(2),3-4-3(2), 3-5-2,4-5-1**\n\n \n\nThroughout AFCON qualification, current manager Bubista has shifted between four and five at the back half the time. What is consistent across both formations is their offensive strength down the left wing. The aforementioned Ryan Mendes and Stopira are crucial to how they play on this side with the former using his skill and speed to draw defenders inside, creating space for Stopira to use wide spaces to deliver crosses and cutbacks. When the Blue Lions employ a back five, Dylan Tavares provides additional width as the wing back with Stopira joining attacks on the left as a ‘free centre-back’. Cape Verde has been effective in using long, diagonal balls from deep in their half to exploit space in behind left by teams that press high. Ethiopia will either want to sit back more than usual or press the players that play these long balls, such as Right centre-backs Steven Fortes and Carlos Ponck.\n\n \n\nCape Verde’s style also exposes itself to a number of weaknesses. For one, while the left side of their defence is excellent in attack, it is a liability in defence as players on that side have been noticed to struggle with incoming crosses and man marking. Whenever Cape Verde play with three out the back, similar problems arise with opposition exploiting the space between center back Stopira and Dylan Tavares, often deployed as a left wing back. Whoever is deployed as a right winger for Ethiopia, likely Amanuel Gebremichael or Abubeker Nassir, alongside fullback Asrat Tonjo, should strive to cause the Blue Sharks issues on this side.\n\n \n\n  Not being tight enough to players in general seems to be an issue for Cape Verde, and they concede a high volume of shots right outside the box for this reason. The Blue Lions like using a highline which leaves them exposed to quick counters; a team well drilled to play out of pressure can take advantage of this highline. Getaneh Kebede will play an important role in drawing in the Cape Verde defenders and creating spaces for the pacy wingers to exploit on the counter.",
