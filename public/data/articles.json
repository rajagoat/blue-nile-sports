    "body": ">  *(Image: PIUS UTOMI EKPEI/AFP via Getty Images)*\n\nEthiopia have exited the 2021 African Cup of Nations after drawing 1-1 with Burkina Faso at the Stade Omnisports de Bafoussam this afternoon. A second half penalty goal from Getaneh Kebede cancelled out Cyrille Bayala’s first half opener in a match the Walias needed a win to have any chance of progressing.\n\nWith the result, Ethiopia finish bottom of group A with just a single point, while Burkina Faso finished second and book their spot in the round of sixteen joining group A winners Cameroon, who drew 1-1 with Cape Verde.\n\nDespite the early elimination, Wubetu Abate’s side can take pride in the marked improvement his side showed in their final game. Ethiopia dominated possession and had six shots on target, restricting Burkina Faso to just two.\n\nThe defense was shored up by the return of Fasil Kenema captain Yared Baye from suspension. His return to the starting eleven was one of four changes made, including captain Getaneh Kebede who was brought back to play at the pinnacle of a 4-2-1-2-1 formation.\n\nEthiopia were the more dangerous of the two sides for swathes of the first half, and came perilously close to scoring in the tenth minute. Ramadan Yesuf and Abubeker Nassir combined before the latter teed off Getaneh Kebede, whose fierce strike from within the penalty box required a fantastic stop from Burkinabe goalkeeper Farid Ouedraogo.\n\n![](/images/uploads/gettyimages-1237788329-1024x1024.jpg)\n\n> *Man of the match Amanuel Yohannes fends off the advances off Burkina Faso's Bertrand Traore as Surafel Dagnachew and Abubeker Nassir look on  (Image: PIUS UTOMI EKPEI/AFP via Getty Images)*\n\nEnd to end action saw Burkina Faso swiftly turn defense into attack seconds later. A Bernard Traore cross towards the box was poorly dealt with by Yared Baye who gifted Hassane Bande a chance to fire home from point blank range, luckily for Yared, Bande scuffed the shot and it was collected easily by Teklemariam Shanko.\n\nDawa Hotessa provided a threat down the right flank on what ended up being something of an off day for Abubeker Nassir.\n\nTwenty-three minutes in, Burkina Faso drew first blood when Adama Guira’s long ball forward reached Cyrille Bayala who found himself with the ball and ‘keeper Teklemariam way off his line and unable to deal with Bayala’s subsequent lob which nestled kindly into the net for the Ajaccio winger’s fourth international goal.\n\nThe goal came a bit against the run of play with Ethiopia controlling the proceedings until then. Ten minutes later, Ethiopia’s relative dominance nearly produced an equalizer.\n\nSurafel Dagnachew threaded a ball through to Dawa Hotessa who fed it to Getaneh Kebede who was again denied from close range by Ouedraogo, this time via an unorthodox kick save that put the ball out for a corner, much to the agony of Coach Wubetu Abate.\n\nEthiopia went into the second half with the same lineup that started the match for the first time at this AFCON. Minutes in, a set piece opportunity saw Surafel’s swing the ball towards the attacking Aschalew Tamene at the near post. The ball came off the arm of Steeve Yago and went out of play.\n\nMauritian official Ahmed Heeralall raced to the monitor in response to the Ethiopians appealing for a penalty. It was the first ever Video Assistant Referee penalty review involving the Walias and the referee correctly pointed to the spot. Getaneh Kebede stepped up and his stutter step runup culminated in his slotting home the equalizer to Ouedraogo’s right.\n\nThere was no second half capitulation for the Walias as there was against Cameroon, however, there were few opportunities created as well. Amanuel Yohannes, who pulled the strings in the midfield all game, was named the Man of the Match by the Confederation of African Football for his efforts.\n\nWith Burkina Faso content to slow things down, Wubetu brought on Bezabeh Meleyo, Amanuel Gebremichael and 20 year old Hawassa Kenema forward Mesfin Tafesse in an attempt to rescue their Cameroon stay.\n\nThe last time these two sides played, Burkina Faso hammered Ethiopia 4-0 in group C of the 2013 AFCON in South Africa, a heartbreaking result that largely dashed Ethiopia’s hopes of progressing.\n\nGetaneh Kebede, Ethiopia’s all time leading goalscorer, who featured as a substitute in that game nine years ago, helped exorcise the demons of Sewnet Bishaw’s team with his record extending 32nd international goal.\n\nEthiopia have demonstrated once again, an ability to dazzle with the ball at their feet. But as was the case in 2013, major finishing inadequacies sees them fall at the first hurdle.",

Those fears were dashed in the second half when reality sunk in and the Indomitable Lions romped to victory, scoring three unanswered goals and making quick work of the East African upstarts.\n\n22 Teklemariam Shanko 5/10\n\nFor the most part, the dip into his rating is solely due to his conceding the most goals by a single goalkeeper at the AFCON so far. Otherwise, he did his best to prevent more goals from going in and was let down by his defense on most of the occasions. Could have done better with his positioning for the first goal, but wasn’t at fault for the rest.\n\n15 Aschalew Tamene 4/10\n\nWas part of a somewhat shaky, but relatively solid back line during an unforgettable first half for the Walias. Aschalew’s clearance of a goalscoring opportunity for a corner in the 38th minute was among his finer moments in the game. In the second half when all went downhill, he was about as poor as he had been great. Was unable to deal with a rampaging Vincent Aboubakar.\n\n4 Mignot Debebe 3/10\n\nStruggled all game to deal with Cameroon’s long balls into the final third. Brought in to replace the suspended Yared Baye, could hardly be blamed when considering that Cameroon’s offensive line is of multiple calibers stronger than anything he has dealt with at St. George FC.\n\n20 Ramadan Yesuf 3/10\n\nA torrid time backtracking, as Cameroon repeatedly penetrated his flank to find their path towards the Ethiopian goal. Defensive positioning exhibited in the 33rd minute was a fleeting reminder of the brilliance he showed against Cape Verde. Cameroon’s equalizing and second goals were a result of the acres of spaces granted to the Indomitable Lions by the 20 year old left back.\n\n2 Suleman Hamid 2/10\n\nPerhaps the worst performer in an Ethiopian shirt. Torn to shreds far too many times to count, his extremely poor man marking saw him caught ball watching for Cameroon’s equalizer. Will be extremely fortunate if he isn’t benched for the final group game.\n\n8 Amanuel Yohannes 4/10\n\nAccustomed to his role connecting the midfield with the back four, his good outing against Cape Verde couldn’t be replicated against the Cameroonians who muscled him off the ball and bossed the midfield, minimizing his influence.\n\n3 Mesud Mohammed 4.5/10\n\nPlayed the lion’s share of the game after being sacrificed early against Cape Verde as a result of Yared Baye’s red card. Formidable effort to establish a presence in the midfield, Mesud was among the Ethiopian players who got the most touches of the ball and exerted himself well before, like the rest of his teammates, fading in the second half.\n\n7 Surafel Dagnachew 4/10\n\nGot a decent effort on goal, and was one of three midfield players who fought and largely struggled to counter the Cameroonian influence. Extremely lucky to have not been dismissed after a number of reckless challenges that on any other day, could have resulted in him getting a second yellow card. Hooked at half time.\n\n11 Amanuel Gebremichael 5.5/10\n\nPerformed admirably with his overlapping runs which opened the Cameroonian defense and led to his setting up Dawa Hotessa with the opening goal. Nearly got on the score sheet himself, surprisingly succeeding in shrugging off a challenge with his wire frame and forcing a save out of Onana. 5.5\n\n10 Abubeker Nassir 5/10\n\nShowed great promise on the big occasion and was at the heart of Ethiopian movements and an inspiring first half that had fans wondering if an upset was on the cards.

That hope quickly dissipated in the second half, and Abubeker’s influence waned terribly.\n\n![](/images/uploads/c54d9796-88fd-4bf8-9311-ce4e7c822579_w1597_n_st.webp)\n\n> *Dawa Hotessa (center) celebrates his landmark goal with skipper Mesud Mohammed (right) and Ramadan Yesuf  (Image: Reuters)*\n\n27 Dawa Hotessa  6/10\n\nBroke a four year international scoring duck to tuck home Ethiopia’s first major tournament goal for eight years.

Cameroon came out looking to grab control of what up until that point been an evenly balanced match. Ethiopia had started the game in magnificent fashion. Those four-minutes of bliss were felt all around the world by everyone who affiliates themselves with the national team’s fanbase.\n\nThis time around, I wasn’t in Washington DC, so the feeling of being even further from home felt even deeper. I jumped up and shouted when Dawa Hotessa exquisitely redirected a precision pass from Amanuel Gebremichael. I was looking pretty crazy to the group of people who had no idea what was taking place. The perfect start, my heart was racing. The game plan that Coach Wubetu Abate had chosen to pursue, appeared to be a masterstroke. The front three speed demons were going to be crucial in putting the lion’s defense under pressure.\n\n![](/images/uploads/brief.jpg)\n\n> *The Ethiopian fan contingent at the Olembe Stadium celebrates Ethiopia's taking of an early lead (Image: Bein Sports)*\n\nHowever, that joy was taken away quickly. Defensive calamity in the Ethiopian final third gifted the Cameroonians the chance to draw level within moments of conceding. Our chronic inability to control the flow in the heat of the moment and act accordingly failed us yet again.\n\nWe saw this in the first game against Cape Verde, and it was evident last night in each and everyone of Cameroon’s goals. There are a whole lot of unwritten rules in football, among those one of them is you’re most vulnerable to concede goals immediately after scoring. This rule applies everywhere, whether it’s pick up footy with the neighbour’s kid in your backyard, whether it’s Sunday league action, or even on football’s biggest stage.\n\nDespite conceding, Ethiopia spent the rest of the half going toe to toe, which was quite frankly the best I have seen the national team play in a long time. There were moments where had the players been slightly more clinical, we could have gone into the half with a priceless lead.\n\nWhat took place after the break was quite simply a massacre, the brutal exposure of one’s core weakness. Cameroon kept on hammering away and had wrapped it all up by the hour mark, leaving fans like myself who were given reason to dream at the halfway mark, stunned and left in total disbelief.\n\nFor the next half hour of play, tactics were changed, substitutions were made in an attempt at damage control. The television broadcast commentator continuously reminded viewers of Ethiopia’s footballing shortcomings and was backed by the camera crew which repeatedly beamed images of crestfallen Ethiopian fans and bewildered looking Ethiopian players on the bench for millions around the world to gaze at.\n\n![](/images/uploads/defeatplayers.jpg)\n\n> *Ethiopian players Bezabeh Meleyo, Ahmed Rashid, Suleman Hamid and Firew Solomon trudge off the pitch after last night's 4-1 defeat to Cameroon (Image: KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images)*\n\nI’ve spent my whole life watching the beautiful game and it was the hardest thirty minutes I had to sit through. As painful as it was, I’m still happy I stuck through to the tail end. Despite defeat, the Walias have come a long way. The gate has been opened again, this time let’s not let it close back on us.\n\nWhen football teams in the world suffer stunning defeats, the question that often follows is how will deflated players rebound from painful on field setbacks. Our players owe it to themselves to make amends and make this day right before the end of their careers.\n\nAs far as us fans are concerned, we will go at it again. The road to football glory is fraught with ups and downs. The national team needs its true fans now more than ever, especially if we are keen on changing history and rewriting everything that has been said about Ethiopian football, for decades. As far as I know, I still won’t miss a minute of national team football no matter what the stage. The revolution will be televised!\n\nUntil we meet again.",

The front three speed demons were going to be crucial in putting the lion’s defense under pressure.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/brief.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The Ethiopian fan contingent at the Olembe Stadium celebrates Ethiopia's taking of an early lead (Image: Bein Sports)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, that joy was taken away quickly. Defensive calamity in the Ethiopian final third gifted the Cameroonians the chance to draw level within moments of conceding. Our chronic inability to control the flow in the heat of the moment and act accordingly failed us yet again.</p>\n<p>We saw this in the first game against Cape Verde, and it was evident last night in each and everyone of Cameroon’s goals. There are a whole lot of unwritten rules in football, among those one of them is you’re most vulnerable to concede goals immediately after scoring. This rule applies everywhere, whether it’s pick up footy with the neighbour’s kid in your backyard, whether it’s Sunday league action, or even on football’s biggest stage.</p>\n<p>Despite conceding, Ethiopia spent the rest of the half going toe to toe, which was quite frankly the best I have seen the national team play in a long time. There were moments where had the players been slightly more clinical, we could have gone into the half with a priceless lead.</p>\n<p>What took place after the break was quite simply a massacre, the brutal exposure of one’s core weakness. Cameroon kept on hammering away and had wrapped it all up by the hour mark, leaving fans like myself who were given reason to dream at the halfway mark, stunned and left in total disbelief.</p>\n<p>For the next half hour of play, tactics were changed, substitutions were made in an attempt at damage control. The television broadcast commentator continuously reminded viewers of Ethiopia’s footballing shortcomings and was backed by the camera crew which repeatedly beamed images of crestfallen Ethiopian fans and bewildered looking Ethiopian players on the bench for millions around the world to gaze at.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/uploads/defeatplayers.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Ethiopian players Bezabeh Meleyo, Ahmed Rashid, Suleman Hamid and Firew Solomon trudge off the pitch after last night's 4-1 defeat to Cameroon (Image: KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP via Getty Images)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I’ve spent my whole life watching the beautiful game and it was the hardest thirty minutes I had to sit through. As painful as it was, I’m still happy I stuck through to the tail end. Despite defeat, the Walias have come a long way. The gate has been opened again, this time let’s not let it close back on us.</p>\n<p>When football teams in the world suffer stunning defeats, the question that often follows is how will deflated players rebound from painful on field setbacks. Our players owe it to themselves to make amends and make this day right before the end of their careers.</p>\n<p>As far as us fans are concerned, we will go at it again. The road to football glory is fraught with ups and downs. The national team needs its true fans now more than ever, especially if we are keen on changing history and rewriting everything that has been said about Ethiopian football, for decades. As far as I know, I still won’t miss a minute of national team football no matter what the stage. The revolution will be televised!</p>\n<p>Until we meet again.</p>\n",

Slack man marking by Collins Fai gave Dawa the space to meet the the St. George midfielder’s low cross and slot it home past the sprawling right leg of Andre Onana in the Cameroonian goal.  \n\n![](/images/uploads/celebration.jpg)\n\n> *The Walias celebrate Dawa Hotessa's opening goal (Image: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images)*\n\nIt was only Dawa’s second international goal and his first in over four years. It was Ethiopia’s first goal at a major international tournament since Adane Girma’s equalizer against Zambia at the 2013 AFCON, and Amanuel would earn Ethiopia’s first finals assist since Salahdin Said on that very same night. The goal sent the contingent of Ethiopian fans at the Olembe stadium wild.\n\nThe lead didn’t last long. A sweetly struck strike by Vincent Choupu Moting was parried away from goal by Teklemariam Shanko minutes later. Fai made amends for his role in the opening goal by delivering a perfect cross that Ekambi drilled home with his head.\n\nWith the score level, the Walias looked menacing on the counterattack, with Abubeker Nassir pulling the strings and looking more and more like the player that Ethiopian fans recognize as the best talent in the Ethiopian top flight. Mid way through the first half, Amanuel Gebremichael broke free yet again, drove forward and managed to shoot but was denied by an unorthodox save from Onana.\n\nMidfielder Surafel Dagnachew, who got the start despite a poor performance against Cape Verde, was lucky to remain on the pitch after a rash challenge only earned him a yellow card.

Teklemariam Shanko got busier in the Ethiopian goal as the night went on, and he could do little about Vincent Aboubakar’s towering header past him. With the Indomitable Lions firmly in the driver’s seat, the night got longer and more painful for the Walias.\n\nThe Ethiopians were visibly rattled after going behind, and much like they were after being reduced to ten men against Cape Verde, they were pegged back into their own half. But they remained unable to plug the gaps on the flanks and there was nobody to stop Moumi Ngamaleu who had charged towards goal nor Aboubakar who slid in from close range to make it four before the hour mark.\n\nTeklemariam did everything he could to prevent it from becoming a total rout, including saving a deflected goal bound Ekambi shot. But there was no stopping Ekambi, when he waltzed into the Ethiopian penalty area, cut the ball back leaving Mignot Debebe and Aschlew Tamene for dead and slammed it into the goal to make it 4-1 in the 67th minute.\n\nGetaneh Kebede was eventually brought on, and he nearly combined with Bezabeh Meleyo for a second goal. On in place of stand in skipper Mesud Mohammed, Bezabeh was unmarked and in the box when he blazed the ball over the bar with minutes to go.  \n\nDespite exhibiting some eye-catching football, Ethiopia was quite simply outclassed, and will now have to defeat Burkina Faso in their final group game on January 17th and hope results elsewhere go their way if they hope to advance to the round of 16 among the best third place finishers.",

Since then, the Ethiopian Premier League has featured fifty clubs, eight different champions and 39 unique teams to suffer relegation. *Blue Nile Sport* crunched the numbers behind over a decade of footballing data, and presents the little known but interesting stats on teams that have suffered the indignity of relegation from Ethiopia’s top flight. \n\nFor starters, 72% of teams that have participated in the Premier League have experienced relegation on at least once occasion.\n\nOut of the eleven clubs that are yet to be relegated,  seven of them are composed of teams that have only recently joined the Premier League, such as Wolaita Dicha, Wolkite Kenema, Mekelle 70 Enderta, Jimma Aba Jifar, Bahir Dar Kenema, FC Shire Endaselassie and Adigrat Wolwalo. This only leaves us with a handful of Premier League mainstays in St. George, winners of the league on a record fourteen occasions under the current format, Hawassa Kenema, Ethiopia Coffee and Sidama Coffee.\n\nThe fact that several league winning club sides which have went on to make the plunge from the Premier League into the lower divisions, such as Dedebit, Defense FC and Ethio Electric, have more title wins than the ever-present Premier League stalwarts in  Hawassa Kenema and Sidama Coffee, highlights the volatility of Ethiopia’s footballing top flight.\n\nBut the foundations of the various relegated sides vary from club to club. For our analysis of Ethiopian Premier League relegation, it is pertinent to ignore the 2007-08 Premier League season, in which midway through the season, a falling out between clubs and the country’s football federation led to a brief lockout and the eventual reinstatement of the clubs, creating a scenario where twenty five club sides competed to stay in the top flight and finish in the top fourteen, relegating the bottom nine teams.\n\n##### **\"Unluckiest\" Relegation**\n\nWhen looking at what can be deemed “unlucky relegations,” we can compare a team’s average points per game with the figure for points per game during seasons that they were relegated. Conversely, we can also label a club “unlucky” by pinpointing just how close a relegated club side was from safety, points-wise.\n\nDuring the 2009-10 season, Ethiopian Insurance FC had its highest rate of points per game outside of the 2007-08 season,  raking in an average of 1.17657 points per match. The team finished fifteenth out of eighteen club sides competing that season with 40 points won from 34 games played, and was relegated.\n\nCompare that with Wolkite Kenema and Dire Dawa Kenema, who last season, finished the league in ninth and tenth place, the relegation cut-off for the thirteen team league. Their points per game averages last season were 0.91667 and 1.1667 respectively, lower than the 1.17657 tallied by Ethiopian Insurance’s relegated side of 2009-10. And yet, both sides managed to escape relegation.\n\nFurthermore, the Ethiopian Premier League all time historical points per game average of clubs that only just avoided relegation, is 0.96896. This depicts relatively low variation and consistency with regards to how teams near the drop zone have performed.\n\nThere are teams that definitely got what came to them, including the likes of Arba Minch in 2004-05  who got an abysmal seven points in 26 matches (winning one and losing 21) and Hadiya Hosanna FC, who tallied just eight points in 26 games during the 2015-16 season.\n\n![](/images/uploads/picsart_1498326508293.jpg)\n\n> Wild celebrations after Habtamu Wolde (barechested) celebrates scoring the winning goal for Dire Dawa City that clinched them Ethiopian Premier League safety at the end of the 2016-17 season. Habtamu's goal came against Jimma Aba Buna, who suffered relegation as a result (Image: [Soccer Ethiopia](https://soccerethiopia.net/football/29157))\n\n##### **Best and worst offense and defence among relegated teams** \n\nWe get a bit of variety in the playing styles of the teams who languish at the bottom of the table. Some teams opted for a more attacking style while others preferred to fortify their defence.\n\nObviously, neither style of play proved particularly effective for these teams. Looking at the average figures for goals scored and conceded among relegated teams,  But looking at the offensive, defensive stats reveal more about the playing styles of these teams.\n\nLooking at the most forward minded of relegated teams, we find two clubs with very similar stats. Nyala Sports Club scored an average of 1.38462 goals per game throughout the 2003-04 season, a near repeat of Berhanena Selam FC who registered a goals per game average of 1.34615 during the 2002-03 season.\n\nThe lowest scoring relegated team is the defunct Arba Minch Cherka Cherk side of 2004-05 and their woeful 0.35 goals per game. These figures are higher than the statistics for clubs last season, but it would be important to take into account the trends for goals scored and conceded in the league across the years. \n\nJimma Aba Buna had an unusually strong defence despite being banished from the Premier League in 2016-17, conceding just 0.73333 goals per game all season. Interestingly, this was the fifth best defense in the league that season and they still couldn’t stay up.\n\nThat 0.73333 goals conceded average would have ranked second best last season, only behind defending champions Fasil Kenema.\n\nOn the flip side, Dire Dawa Cherka Cherk conceded the most of any relegated team. They shipped an average of 2.4091 goals per game during the 1999-2000 season.\n\n##### **Frequencies of relegation and promotion**\n\nOf the relegated teams, Nyala FC has seen itself relegated on four separate occasions, while Ethiopian Insurance has made the drop three times.\n\nWhile it may be customary to laugh at the annual yo-yo clubs, they’ve also demonstrated tremendous resilience to be able to repeatedly fight their way back into the Premier League after relegation.\n\n![](/images/uploads/template-for-graphics.png)\n\n> A list of \"yo-yo\" clubs, who foght their way back to the Premier League\n\nIs such resilience normal or are these teams outliers? To find out, we took a look at the last season that a club that has been relegated at least once from the league was involved in.  \n\nAvailable data shows that five teams that have been relegated have since won promotion and returned to participate in last season’s league competition. These are Adama Kenema, Dire Dawa Kenema, Fasil Kenema, Hadiya Hosanna and Sebeta Kenema.\n\nWhile this is great, this only accounts for 13% of relegated teams. The grand majority of the relegated teams have been away from the Premier League for a long time. This fact coupled with the fact that the Ethiopian Premier League has been graced by a total of 54 different teams, speaks to the diversity of teams coming up from Ethiopia’s lower tier leagues. \n\nList of Ethiopian Premier League teams to have experienced relegation (in alphabetical order): \n\n Adama Kenema, Addis Ababa Kenema, Addis Ababa Police, Agricultural Marketing, Arba Minch Cherka Cherk, Arba Minch Kenema, Ethiopian Air Force, Bahir Dar University, Banks, Berhanena Selam FC, Dashen Beer, Southern Police, Dedebit, Dire Dawa Cherka Cherk, Dire Dawa Kenema, Dire Dawa Railway, Ethio Electric, Ethiopian Water Works, Fincha Sugar, Guna Trading FC, Hadiya Hosanna, Harar Beer, Harar City, Jimma Aba Bunna, Kombolcha Cherka Cherk, Ethiopian Insurance, Defense FC, Meta Brewery, Metehara Sugar, Muger Cement FC, Nyala, Omedla, Sebeta Kenema, Shashemene Kenema, Tikur Abay Transport, Trans Ethiopia, Woldia Kenema, Wonji Sugar.",

One of the most successful African football sides, qualifying for the FIFA World Cup more than any other African team, the Indomitable Lions have however, endured trialing times in recent years, failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup and last earning a point at the finals of a world cup way back at Korea/Japan 2002 when a single goal courtesy of Samuel Etoo saw them top Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\nAFCON success wasn’t that long ago, as Cameroon won their fifth title in 2017. In 2022, Cameroon will hope to overcome the curse that comes with hosting the tournament, as no AFCON host nation has won the tournament or even reached the semifinals since Egypt did so way back in 2006. \n\n\n\nCameroon’s last AFCON showing saw the high profile appointment of Dutch football great Clarence Seedorf as manager in the build up to the tournament, before his unceremonious sacking following the team’s elimination at the quarterfinal stage. His successor in Toni Conceição has a comparatively lower profile and little in terms of managerial experience in African football, having spent much of the past two decades at the helm of club sides in Europe including in his native Portugal and Romania. Nevertheless, Cameroon have demonstrated consistency throughout the AFCON qualifiers, topping their group and losing just once away to Cape Verde, who they will face at the finals on January 17th. The Indomitable Lions eliminated Cote d’Ivoire from 2022 Qatar World Cup contention, defeating them in a do or die encounter last November to seal their place in the final playoff round.\n\n\n\nStyle Of Play:\n\nFormations employed: 4-3-3(Primary formation),4-4-2, 3-5-2\n\n\n\nThroughout recent World Cup and African Cup of Nations qualifying encounters, Cameroon have been relatively unable to overwhelm their opponents, even those they were expected to dominate ‘lesser’ with the amount of possession and or shots on goal. Cameroon edge many of their opponents solely by the quality of their players, which perception wise, could be deemed a weakness or a strength.  \n\n\n\nDespite this, they’ve not been short on results, with AFCON qualification going smoothly. Cameroon have looked most imperious during world cup qualifiers, scoring 12 and only conceding three. Cameroon have excelled with set piece opportunities.\n\n\n\nThe Indomitable Lions will look to improve on play from the back, which has been sloppy and can be taken advantage of by teams who play a high pressing game, as was seen by goals recently conceded against Cape Verde and Mozambique. Additionally, Cameroon defense would need to work on dealing with through balls better, with Cameroonian  centre backs seen struggling to deal with them and frequently caught out with too much space between them.\n\n\n\nPlayers to Watch:\n\n\n\nVincent Aboubakar\n\nThe 29 year old striker and skipper has maintained a solid 0.46 goals per game playing his trade in the top flights of France, Portugal and Turkey. This year, he has contributed to 10 goals in 16 games for the Saudi-based Al-Nassr.  For the national team, he has not been quite as prolific, scoring a goal every three games. He does have the tendency to pop up with goals for the team in a stalemate, with him scoring the crucial late winner against Egypt in the 2017 AFCON final. While not the most technically gifted, he is a capable number 9 in terms of his link up play, and a deadly finisher.\n\n \n\n\n\nEric Maxim Choupo-Moting\n\nHaving started off his career primarily playing as an inside forward on the left wing, Moting has been transitioned to playing as the central striker for Bayern Munich. For the indomitable Lions, he has more versatility, being deployed on the wing and in behind in addition to playing central striker. Across all these positions he carries the threat of pace, direct dribbling and finishing with his preferred right foot. Something that sets Choupo-Moting apart from most modern day inside forwards is his physicality, height (6’ 2”) and heading ability. He’ll be a handful for the Ethiopian defense. Throughout his career, Moteng has struggled with his offside awareness and teams have exploited this through offside traps.\n\n\n\nMartin Hongla\n\nA mainstay on the right side of midfield for Cameroon, he can also operate as a defensive midfielder, which he does at club level for Serie A side Hellas Verona. Despite his holding role, he has proven to be one of the main creative outlets for this Cameroonian team. When Cameroon deploy a 4-3-3 formation, Hongla is frequently seen creating chances by drifting to wide areas on the right when opposing defenders are preoccupied with Cameroon's right back. From this area of the pitch, he is known for his ability to deliver dangerous early crosses into the box. When playing with a 4-4-2 formation (which Cameroon rarely do) he tends to be selected as a right midfielder and occupies the wide areas for most of the game.",

    "body": "*(Image: Confederation of African Football)*\n\nOctober 14th 2012 was a historical day in the hearts of many Ethiopian football fans; it marked the East African country’s return to the African Cup of Nations after 31 long years. On the same day, on the other side of the continent, a much smaller nation was having a seminal moment of its own, Cape Verde qualified for its first tournament after an aggregate win over Cameroon. While qualification could be seen as ‘a return to form’ or ‘the rightful place’ for Ethiopians with memories of more successful generations, Cape Verde’s qualification and success came from scratch. The Island Nation’s football development started relatively late due to the length of Portuguese colonialism. Their football federation was formed in 1982 and only joined FIFA in 1986.\n\nIt begs the question of how Cape Verde Made an astronomical rise to the top of the CAF rankings in 2016? One of the biggest reasons was the strategy employed by the Blue Lions to start recruiting players of Cape Verdean ancestry who played in Europe in the 2000s, as the Cape Verdean diaspora outnumber the native population this gave the federation the option to select players with access to first-world academy development, training centers and leagues. It is with these kinds of players that Cape Verde has managed to join the upper echelons of African football with a population of 500,000. The current squad only contains one player that plays in the local league,a stark contrast to the Ethiopian squad.\n\n \n\n \n\n**Players to Watch:**\n\n\n\n***Ryan Mendes(Left winger)*:** Cape Verde's most dangerous asset, this experienced talisman plays his club football as a winger. For Cape Verde, the skipper is usually deployed as an inverted winger on the left as part of the three, or is partnered up with a target man as the second striker.  He has had experience in top-flight European football such as Lille and Nottingham Forest. He has the ability to obliterate highlines with his pace, dribbling, and dangerous right foot. He was involved in 4 of 11 goals for Cape Verde this calendar year.\n\n***Julio Tavares(striker)*:** at 6 ‘2’’, is very much a traditional target man. Most goals for him come  from crosses into the box. He has had quite a success at club level, (he is the all-time top scorer for Dijon with 69 goals). He has not replicated his scoring record with the national team but he plays the facilitator role, using his physicality to link up play via passes and flicks inside the box for his team mates. On set pieces, he will be one of the players that Cape Verde will look to get the ball to.\n\n***Stopira*:** part of the dangerous left hand side of CV’s attack, he has contributed to 3 goals in 8 competitive games this calendar year while also assisting 2 goals . He is also versatile as he can play both in the traditional left back role as well as the ‘Free Centre Back’ in a three man defence.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n**Style Of Play:**\n\n\n\n**Formations employed: 4-3-3(3),5-3-2(2),3-4-3(2), 3-5-2,4-5-1**\n\n \n\nThroughout AFCON qualification, current manager Bubista has shifted between four and five at the back half the time. What is consistent across both formations is their offensive strength down the left wing. The aforementioned Ryan Mendes and Stopira are crucial to how they play on this side with the former using his skill and speed to draw defenders inside, creating space for Stopira to use wide spaces to deliver crosses and cutbacks. When the Blue Lions employ a back five, Dylan Tavares provides additional width as the wing back with Stopira joining attacks on the left as a ‘free centre-back’. Cape Verde has been effective in using long, diagonal balls from deep in their half to exploit space in behind left by teams that press high. Ethiopia will either want to sit back more than usual or press the players that play these long balls, such as Right centre-backs Steven Fortes and Carlos Ponck.\n\n \n\nCape Verde’s style also exposes itself to a number of weaknesses. For one, while the left side of their defence is excellent in attack, it is a liability in defence as players on that side have been noticed to struggle with incoming crosses and man marking. Whenever Cape Verde play with three out the back, similar problems arise with opposition exploiting the space between center back Stopira and Dylan Tavares, often deployed as a left wing back. Whoever is deployed as a right winger for Ethiopia, likely Amanuel Gebremichael or Abubeker Nassir, alongside fullback Asrat Tonjo, should strive to cause the Blue Sharks issues on this side.\n\n \n\n  Not being tight enough to players in general seems to be an issue for Cape Verde, and they concede a high volume of shots right outside the box for this reason. The Blue Lions like using a highline which leaves them exposed to quick counters; a team well drilled to play out of pressure can take advantage of this highline. Getaneh Kebede will play an important role in drawing in the Cape Verde defenders and creating spaces for the pacy wingers to exploit on the counter.",
